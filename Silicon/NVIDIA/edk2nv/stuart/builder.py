            This allows NVIDIA-specific changes to how the Conf directory is

            - Use a platform-specific Conf directory.
            - Allow minor changes to Conf files while still using the upstream
              templates.

            Convince stuart to use `settings.GetConfDirName()` as the Conf
            directory.  If the Conf directory does not exist, it will be
            populated with the template.

            Stuart is hard-coded to always use <workspace_root>/Conf as its
            Conf directory.  However, we want to have platform-specific Conf
            directories.  In the near term, that avoids race conditions when
            building multiple platforms in parallel.  In the long term, should
            we choose to customize the contents of the Conf directory for a
            given platform, we'll have a way to do that.

            build.py allows the Conf directory to be moved via command line or
            via env.  Since stuart wraps our call to build.py, we'll rely on
            the env.

            Sometimes, we want to make minor changes to the Conf files, e.g.
            tools_def.txt.  We'll do that in this hook.  Alternatively, we
            could fork the templates, but then we'd have to maintain the forks
            and continually reintegrate upstream changes to the templates.
