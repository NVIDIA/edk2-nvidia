/**
  Returns information about the current firmware image(s) of the device.

  This function allows a copy of the current firmware image to be created and saved.
  The saved copy could later been used, for example, in firmware image recovery or rollback.

  @param[in]      This               A pointer to the EFI_FIRMWARE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in, out] ImageInfoSize      A pointer to the size, in bytes, of the ImageInfo buffer.
                                     On input, this is the size of the buffer allocated by the caller.
                                     On output, it is the size of the buffer returned by the firmware
                                     if the buffer was large enough, or the size of the buffer needed
                                     to contain the image(s) information if the buffer was too small.
  @param[in, out] ImageInfo          A pointer to the buffer in which firmware places the current image(s)
                                     information. The information is an array of EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTORs.
  @param[out]     DescriptorVersion  A pointer to the location in which firmware returns the version number
                                     associated with the EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR.
  @param[out]     DescriptorCount    A pointer to the location in which firmware returns the number of
                                     descriptors or firmware images within this device.
  @param[out]     DescriptorSize     A pointer to the location in which firmware returns the size, in bytes,
                                     of an individual EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR.
  @param[out]     PackageVersion     A version number that represents all the firmware images in the device.
                                     The format is vendor specific and new version must have a greater value
                                     than the old version. If PackageVersion is not supported, the value is
                                     0xFFFFFFFF. A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates that package version comparison
                                     is to be performed using PackageVersionName. A value of 0xFFFFFFFD indicates
                                     that package version update is in progress.
  @param[out]     PackageVersionName A pointer to a pointer to a null-terminated string representing the
                                     package version name. The buffer is allocated by this function with
                                     AllocatePool(), and it is the caller's responsibility to free it with a call

/**
  Updates the firmware image of the device.

  This function updates the hardware with the new firmware image.
  This function returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the firmware image is not updatable.
  If the firmware image is updatable, the function should perform the following minimal validations
  before proceeding to do the firmware image update.
  - Validate the image authentication if image has attribute
    IMAGE_ATTRIBUTE_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED. The function returns
    EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATION if the validation fails.
  - Validate the image is a supported image for this device. The function returns EFI_ABORTED if
    the image is unsupported. The function can optionally provide more detailed information on
    why the image is not a supported image.
  - Validate the data from VendorCode if not null. Image validation must be performed before
    VendorCode data validation. VendorCode data is ignored or considered invalid if image
    validation failed. The function returns EFI_ABORTED if the data is invalid.

  VendorCode enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update policy. Null if
  the caller did not specify the policy or use the default policy. As an example, vendor can implement
  a policy to allow an option to force a firmware image update when the abort reason is due to the new
  firmware image version is older than the current firmware image version or bad image checksum.
  Sensitive operations such as those wiping the entire firmware image and render the device to be
  non-functional should be encoded in the image itself rather than passed with the VendorCode.
  AbortReason enables vendor to have the option to provide a more detailed description of the abort
  reason to the caller.

  @param[in]  This               A pointer to the EFI_FIRMWARE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  ImageIndex         A unique number identifying the firmware image(s) within the device.

  @param[in]  Image              Points to the new image.
  @param[in]  ImageSize          Size of the new image in bytes.
  @param[in]  VendorCode         This enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update policy.
                                 Null indicates the caller did not specify the policy or use the default policy.
  @param[in]  Progress           A function used by the driver to report the progress of the firmware update.
