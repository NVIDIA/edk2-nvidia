= Device discovery service driver =
  Provides system services to enumerate and install components for otherwise non-discoverable devices

== Details ==

The driver will cause the device tree to be processed for each driver that exposes
gNVIDIADeviceTreeCompatibilityProtocolGuid. Each node on the device tree will be passed to the driver's Supported
function. If the driver returns EFI_SUCCESS the device discovery driver will detect and map the memory of the node
into the system MMU. After this a device handle will be created to expose this to the device driver.
This handle will contain information regarding the location of the device tree node, a device path based on the
first memory map region, and the non-discoverable device protocol. If the device driver supports the driver binding
protocol, then the non-discoverable device protocol will be installed with a non-standard GUID and a non-recursive
ConnectController() will be invoked.

== Device Driver Usage ==

The primary task the driver needs to do is install a device handle with the compatibilty protocol and return
EFI_SUCCESS for correct device nodes. If the driver needs to perform controller initialization then it should
expose a driver binding protocol on the same handle. If the controller initialization is not required to be done
if the hardware is not in the boot path the functional driver binding protocol should be exposed on a seperate device
handle.

If the driver initiates the hardware initialization in an asynch manner then the DriverHealth protocol should be
supported and RepairRequired should be returned while this process is occuring.

== Device Library Usage ==

There may be cases where a full UEFI driver model method can not be used as the interface with external components
require a library to be implemented. In this case the library should register a depex with
gNVIDIADeviceEnumerationPresentProtocolGuid and prior to detecting the hardware they should install the compatibilty
protocol. This will trigger an immediate callback to the device discovery driver to perform an enumeration.
When the DxeCore returns from the install function the library can then get the non-discoverable device protocols to
locate the appropriate instances.

          note right
            Protocols can either be services exposed by hardware
            or protocols that service driver binds to.
            Example of second type would be the NonDiscoverable protocol with type XHCI.
            This would allow for other drivers to provide USB services
            Processing in start() should mainly be limited actions required for boot regardless of boot device.
